# Camera Scan Program

This program is designed to scan and detect any camera connected to your system. After running, it identifies and displays the connected camera for you.
## Features:

  Live Camera Display: Shows the detected camera feed live.
  Live Display & Recording: Displays and records the live feed from the detected camera.
  Recording Only: Records the detected camera feed without displaying it live.

## Note:
If you use the recording feature, a recorded video file named output.mp4 will be saved in the program's directory once you exit the program.

## Prerequisite:
The program requires the opencv-python library. You can install it by running:


```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## Updates
We are continuously working to improve this program and plan to release exciting updates. Stay tuned!
